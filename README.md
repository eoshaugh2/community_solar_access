Scripts for "Evaluating community solar as a measure to promote equitable clean energy access"

This folder contains scripts to run analysis for the paper “Evaluating community solar as a measure to promote equitable clean energy access.” The folder does not include scripts used for data cleaning, though the authors would be happy to answer inquiries about data cleaning upon request.

**Data availability**
As noted in the paper’s Data Availability Statement, the study uses some proprietary data that cannot be shared. Nonetheless, much of the underlying data are publicly available through data sets published by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 

Tracking the Sun provides household-level data for rooftop solar systems: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OyPLDXH1WkDpyA_z88hR5Bgof7Z-IvRQ/view?usp=drive_web

LBL Solar Demographics provides adopter demographic data down to a tract level: https://emp.lbl.gov/solar-demographics-tool

Because of the data restrictions, most of the scripts in this package cannot be run. However, the script “figures” is configured to be run to allow users to generate the five figures in the main text of the study.

**Contents**
